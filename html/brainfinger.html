        <h3>Relation Between Fingerprints and Brain</h3>

        <p>Dermatoglyphics is an integration of neuroscience, medicine, genetics, psychology and behavioral science and
            it is based on the formation and the amount of ridges present on the finger prints. Medical science has
            already confirmed that during the growth of the foetus within the mother’s womb from the 13th – 19th week,
            fingerprints are formed simultaneously with the development of the neocortex. They begin to develop in the
            embryo in the 13th week, and are formed by the 24th week.It is closely related to the infant’s brain
            development. The distribution of prints is considered to represent brain cells’ proportion and distribution
            in each of the brain lobes.Through research, geneticists have proven that dermatoglyph formations are
            controlled by chromosomes, and the patterns are influenced by polygenetic inheritance. </p>

        <p>Human brain has two parts (Left Brain & right Brain) and each part consists of five lobes. These ten lobes
            have different functionalities and these lobes are correlated with fingerprints of both hands. the hands are
            sources of physiological and psychological information waiting to be tapped, hence the increasing importance
            in the field of dermatoglyphics.IT is closely related to the infant’s brain development. The distribution of
            prints is considered to represent brain cells’ proportion and distribution in each of the brain lobes.</p>

        <p><b>The strong correlation between brain and fingerprints noticed by American doctors who discovered babies
            had no brain, and the fact was revealed on that time that those babies did not have fingerprints either.
            This child is called an Anenchephalous child. During pregnancy, if mother suffers from severe Folic Acid
            deficiency, the Anenchephalous child is born.</b></p>
